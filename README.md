### Test the Library

Temporarily comment out the `hwHelper.run()` function and click the **Execute** button at the top to test whether the library was loaded properly.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2d5e9b-5653-4c4a-bf3f-8fec918dc444)

You should see the following prompt:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/268495c0-2e7b-47d4-bd31-394f572ac07d)

Uncomment `hwHelper.run()` to prepare it for execution.

### Field Explanations:

Set the parameters to suit your needs:
- **HW_TITLE**: The title (copied) of a specific homework assignment you want the assistant to solve. Use `'ALL'` to check all pending assignments.
- **NAME**: Your student name. This will be used to fill your essays, works, slides, etc.
- **REG**: Your student registration. This will also be used to fill your works.
- **CLASSES**: An array of exact class names where the bot will search for assignments.
- **TASK_LIST_NAME**: The name of the task list where notifications about completed assignments will be posted.

# Set the API Keys

In this project, we are using two main services that require API keys. Hereâ€™s how to set them up.

1. **Click** on the left menu and select the gear icon labeled **Project Configuration**.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cccc3a0a-d390-470e-96ef-a37da89bc6a7)

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and **click** the button labeled **Add Command Sequence Property**.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f9e3f8a-a9a8-4dc8-b538-4a210fd8cb9a)

This will open two fields: **Property** and **Value**. In the **Property** field, enter the alias for your API key as it will appear in your code. Letâ€™s see the two API keys that we will place here:

---

## Gemini API Key

1. In the **Property** field, use the name `GEMINI_API_KEY` (you can use any name, but ensure it matches your code).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c77068f-cb9d-45f3-9492-4d77168c88c0)

2. To get the Gemini API key, visit [Google's AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/u/1/apikey) and log in with the preferred account.

3. On the left-side menu, **Click** on **Get API Key**.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7e354b-daf5-47c4-a3a2-5443928cf49e)

4. Then select the **Create API Key** button.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922473dc-c2aa-445d-9336-64db9c7df81c)

5. A pop-up will display your new API key. **Copy** the key and paste it into the **Value** field in the Google Script input.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f0b9039-360a-4452-a13d-f044131f75d8)

6. **Click** the **Save Command Sequence Property** button just below the input.

---

## GitHub API Key

Add another **Command Sequence Property** for the GitHub API key.

1. To retrieve or generate your **GitHub API Key** (Personal Access Token), follow these steps:

   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) or go directly to the [GitHub API Key Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and log in to your account.
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.

2. **Access Developer Settings**:

   - In the left-hand sidebar, scroll down and click **Developer settings**.
   - Click on **Personal Access Tokens**.
   - Then click **Tokens (classic)** to view or generate classic tokens.
   - Alternatively, use **Fine-grained tokens** for more specific permissions (recommended for newer projects).

3. **Generate a New Token**:

   - Click **Generate new token**.
   - Select the necessary **scopes**. For this project, ensure *repo status* and *public_repo* are selected.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54be8443-7a23-4713-9455-bf0975b37ee9)

4. **Save your token** immediately after generation, as it will not be displayed again.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7acb13f3-bdd0-4edf-8169-442f4ab7da66)

5. Copy and paste the generated GitHub API key into the **Google Script** Property Value field.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d06f41b-ad9b-47fe-b0d3-96463361feec)

6. Finally, **click** the **Save Properties** button.

## Set API Keys in the Library

Now, we need to pass these keys to the library so that it can use them. Back in the script editor, add the following lines of code:

```javascript
const GITHUB_USERNAME = 'ThaManWithoutFear';
const GITHUB_REPO_NAME = 'HW_HELPER';

const properties = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperties();
const GEMINI_API_KEY = properties['GEMINI_API_KEY'];
const GITHUB_API_KEY = properties['GITHUB_API_KEY'];

const GH_CREDENTIALS = {
  githubToken: GITHUB_API_KEY,
  username: GITHUB_USERNAME,
  repoName: GITHUB_REPO_NAME
};
```

Here, you define your GitHub username and the repo name you want to use. You can leave this option blank, and it will default to the `'HW_HELPER'` repo name.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0253825c-2292-437e-ada0-e83afbfc4cd1)

Then, add the parameters to the `run` function:

```javascript
hwHelper.run(HW_TITLE, NAME, REG, GH_CREDENTIALS, GEMINI_API_KEY, CLASSES, TASK_LIST_NAME);
```
